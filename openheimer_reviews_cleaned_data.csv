"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.",one anticipated film year many people included oppenheimer largely delivers much great i feel like i loved two three hour liked hour fact stop adoring entire thing i know christopher nolans dunkirk clicked second watch maybe oppenheimer need one that said i dont feel need rush see soon long exhausting filmbut many way i cant deny exceptionally well made one it look sound amazing youd expect feeling though accurately capture time period set containing amazing sound design one year best score far every performance good great film belongs cillian murphy i feel like he lead actor beat stage talking early award considerationthe film best focus psychological thriller featuring famous historical figure one point even turn psychological horror film there one sequence involving speech thats particularly terrifying it also manages suspenseful moment even though story commonly known history pointi really feel length final hour though maybe i wish final act extended epilogue rather whole third movie i currently feel though i wouldve loved oppenheimer hour instead nothing bad mean little patience testing subjective i remember feeling like similarly long babylon totally justified runtime though others didnt feel wayim left feeling like i watched film wasnt slam dunk incredible runtime wasnt and thats still worth celebrating make oppenheimer worth seeing cinema sure,"Counter({'NOUN': 58, 'VERB': 50, 'ADJ': 31, 'ADV': 25, 'PRON': 19, 'AUX': 8, 'NUM': 7, 'SCONJ': 7, 'PROPN': 6, 'PART': 5, 'DET': 1, 'ADP': 1, 'CCONJ': 1})","['one', 'three hour', 'christopher', 'dunkirk', 'second', 'one year', 'cillian murphy', 'one', 'one', 'third', 'wayim']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 3, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest.

"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.Ludwig Göransson's work in the musical aspect of the film is masterful, on par with Nolan's previous works. Visiting the score on a daily basis. The cinematography is stunning and the editing is cutting edge.

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking!

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought.

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here.

"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying.

"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",oppenheimer biographical thriller film written directed christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy inception

"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---A big portion of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The pacing is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.",i familiar manhattan project social political aftermath oppenheimer excursion known territoryis nolans finest movie date not really because i know even better doe touch upon greatness yes couple timesthe great cillian murphy give one surprising leading man performance age might win oscar excellent portrayal robert oppenheimer he fully transforms highly complex increasingly conflicted man eye ooze tension voice point demeanour congruentthe entire nd act building manhattan project los alamo laboratory eventual detonation first atomic bomb best part movieoppenheimers shaken stirred speech trinity test arguably engrossing immersive moviemaking summergreat hollywood actor actress galoremany poignant time jump editsthe scene oppenheimer president truman oval officehair makeup department convincingly depicts oppenheimer rest student year last stage livesin surprisingly typical nolan fashion ending satisfying slightly fizzled rd act twist built throughout moviethe not so great a big portion movie dissapointing baitandswitch it focus way much time oppenheimer pretrinity political activity posttrinity kangaroo trial without satisfactory reason the st especially overly long rd act needed tighter editing movie would better the buildup powerful ending could easily slightly modified still pack even bigger much needed gutwrenching punchthe pacing overly dense try jampack much oppies pre posttrinity life one movie nolan add plethora new character barely remember time jump edits sometimes unnecessary hard follownot nearly enough movie actual technical feat building first atomic bomb,"Counter({'NOUN': 74, 'ADJ': 39, 'VERB': 30, 'PROPN': 26, 'ADV': 24, 'PRON': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 4, 'PART': 2, 'SCONJ': 2, 'INTJ': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'ADP': 2})","['manhattan', 'robert oppenheimer', 'manhattan', 'los alamo', 'first', 'officehair makeup department', 'one', 'first']","Counter({'GPE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 1, 'FAC': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1})"

"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",okay nolan fan get finger poised downvote im say thats way i understand high rating film thousand devoted nolan fan inflating score because youre honest there way mottled mess movie not

"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I studied Oppenheimer in college and he was a brilliant, complicated, odd man. Very interesting to study him. I'm not sure what I expected of this movie, but Cillian Murphy's stilted, complex, weird version was not it!Understanding the invention of the atomic bomb is very important because it changed the world. Making this oddly jumpy and overly complicated movie did nothing to help the average person truly understand the process and what actually happened during the years the atom bomb was born. While I understood what was happening as the story unfolded, if I had not already understood the history, I'm not sure I would have fully comprehended the importance this process, this time, these people.Too me? It seemed bloated with too many big Hollywood actors appearing all throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan's self-centered bow to how many Hollywood ""stars"" he could feature in a movie. It was too much talk, talk, talk; too much jumping around in history; too much show off of Nolan's success in Hollywood. And too little solid information being given about the unfolding of one of the most devastating events outside of all the wars in the 20th century - the discovery of a weapon of mass destruction that killed millions of people in Japan. The fact that the Enola Gay, the plane that delivered the bombs, wasn't even mentioned? A three hour movie and a moment that changed the world isn't even given its due?I am definitely not an elitist. I don't ""get"" modern art, I never get invited to posh parties. I am an average American who still knows more about Doctor Oppenheimer than was portrayed in that very long, very strange interpretation of this event. It was a terribly missed opportunity that annoys me. But Hollywood is Hollywood. And they miss the mark 90% of the time.

"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",at core oppenheimer technical masterpiece the haunting score ludwig göransson one film profound highlight the score act character build arc throughout film peak arguably best moment bomb drop paired aggressive bold sound design transport screen sound aspect make film truly remarkablethere fault incredible acting monumental cast oppenheimer murphy play oppenheimer way enables audience feel gravity situation historical repercussion follow however robert downey jr play lewis strauss arguably best oppenheimer cast brings downey jr perfectly portrays slow spiral eventual downfall characterthe film shine shift psychological element focusing oppenheimer impact action effect person the scene small theatre give speech success bomb easily one film haunting gutwrenching momentsi wish moment like thatif film followed psychological approach closely engagement level would higher making run time feel considerably shorter however third act portrayal oppenheimer political scapegoat done well see actor shinehowever oppenheimer flaw the nonlinear timeline used abundantly nolan sometimes struggle fastpaced switching the overload character interviewed heavy dialogue constant time change time make difficult follow political aspect story engagement level first last act low making story feel dull sluggish a stated script studied immense impact event oppenheimer family psychological level would helped meandering political story flow smoothly and yes threehour run time could definitely cut least minto summarise oppenheimer technical masterpiece sound design soundtrack cinematography acting peak game it portrays political impact creation atomic bomb america world however pacing issue extended run time heavy political agenda steer u away effect oppenheimer provide problem otherwise strong film,"Counter({'NOUN': 99, 'VERB': 43, 'ADJ': 41, 'PROPN': 21, 'ADV': 19, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'NUM': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'INTJ': 1})","['one', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr play', 'one', 'third', 'first']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 2, 'PERSON': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2})"

It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months.

"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing.",im big nolan fan maybe one wasnt methis movie promoted story invention bomb we told see biggest screen go way imax mm projection least get regular mm laser imaxit turn nolans visuals still look good movie there nothing breathtaking warrant format it like michelin star local theater format might well go thats probably true movieit also turn mostly story political vendetta marketing bomb exploding little movie whole trailer really one scene i guess wasnt interesting way approach los alamo part story what could focus scientific challenge not really best source storywe get review oppenheimer security clearance lead retelling history flashback story creating bomb told well personal relationship i guess communist party member character played pugh naked time sure necessary time get much shorter story confirmation hearing strauss flashback couple meeting involved oppenheimer it political drama much drama there isnt enough emotional connection character care will oppenheimer lose security clearance will strauss get served karma cabinet confirmation hearing who care if youre invested character would care happens endmaybe best one source material maybe mistake wanting tell particular story maybe better writing staying away gimmick two timeline flashback intersecting couldve told story better maybe time nolan let go gimmick movie trust subject matterunlike previous nolan movie i wont thinking movie much wanting watch understand better there nothing else therefor isnt one top movie technically great acting also great writing editing isnt therealso imax great every movie benefit this one really didnt maybe nolan wasnt focused technical side hed able get emotionally invested storyediti come back add comparable movie much better job show tell story real tensionthe imitation gamea movie genius trying solve problem war that topic science heavy movie go personal struggle relationship personal consequence suffered politics timethe tension focused task breaking german code not happen lead character year later it lot easier invested even though know war v the result political hearing,"Counter({'NOUN': 114, 'VERB': 59, 'ADJ': 42, 'ADV': 31, 'PROPN': 19, 'PRON': 18, 'AUX': 17, 'PART': 10, 'NUM': 5, 'DET': 4, 'ADP': 3, 'SCONJ': 2})","['big nolan fan', 'michelin', 'one', 'los alamo', 'one', 'two', 'german', 'year later']","Counter({'CARDINAL': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'FAC': 1, 'NORP': 1, 'DATE': 1})"
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.",my review oppenheimer my rating ten plus in cinema nowif movie represent last one hundred year existence planet placed time capsule opened year time chance planet still existence oppenheimerthis truly astonishing achievement cinema storytelling covering wide arc world event personality played pivotal role th century affect u today many still responsible fear instability around globeoppenheimer written directed christopher nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit hour enlighteningi found shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lie spread like cancer undermine reputation detestable character like hitler j edgar hoover senator joseph mccarthy mussolini mentioned establish timeline name dont appear oppenheimer however influence consequence tyranny obvious examine life julius robert oppenheimer studied physic germany returning america eventually recruited work manhattan projectin oppenheimer appointed director manhattan project situated desert new mexico los alamo laboratory town specifically built one purpose the personnel los alamo oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapon four year start german nuclear weapon programthe second half oppenheimer i found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction bombing hiroshima nagasaki japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planetthe oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie now i become death destroyer world sum suspicion guilt fear destruction two city nagasaki hiroshima president harry truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare kyoto beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon after event oppenheimer vilified investigated communist witch hunt many ego driven powerful adversary summon testify hearing prove he traitorthe performance oppenheimer stunning cast includes cillian murphy emily blunt robert downey jr matt damon kenneth branagh tom conti josh harnett florence pugh ramus malek casey afffleckthe four standout performance irish actor cillian murphy title role j robert oppenheimer truly oscar worthy performance he impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife kitty played emily blunt one finest performance moment movie also earn oscar nominationthe standouts robert downey jr a lewis strauss vindictive complicated associate oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambitionthe look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local gmax interestingly oppenheimer first ever imax film partially shot mm black white celluloid kodak developed first ever film stock imax process order black white footage look quality rest moviei sum saying oppenheimer finest interesting biography movie ive seen cinema many year congratulate christopher nolan i think greatest movie yet,"Counter({'NOUN': 128, 'PROPN': 87, 'VERB': 57, 'ADJ': 46, 'ADV': 21, 'PRON': 11, 'NUM': 9, 'ADP': 5, 'DET': 4, 'AUX': 3, 'INTJ': 2, 'CCONJ': 1, 'X': 1, 'PART': 1, 'SCONJ': 1})","['ten', 'year', 'century', 'today', 'christopher nolan', 'hour', 'shakespearian portrayal', 'joseph mccarthy mussolini', 'robert oppenheimer', 'germany', 'america', 'manhattan', 'manhattan', 'new mexico', 'los alamo', 'los alamo', 'first', 'four year', 'german', 'second', 'half', 'hiroshima', 'nagasaki', 'japan', 'today', 'two', 'nagasaki', 'hiroshima', 'harry truman', 'cillian', 'murphy', 'robert downey jr matt', 'kenneth branagh', 'tom conti josh', 'four', 'irish', 'cillian murphy', 'robert oppenheimer', 'kitty', 'one', 'robert downey', 'first', 'kodak', 'first', 'many year', 'christopher nolan']","Counter({'PERSON': 14, 'GPE': 10, 'DATE': 6, 'CARDINAL': 5, 'ORDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'FAC': 2, 'TIME': 1, 'ORG': 1})"
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",nolan good constructing complicated timing event but good telling biopic the first half movie need long built introduces many charcters important story heisenberg jean tatlock so could cut half hour easily speed thing upthe second thing i let focus story the main struggle building atomic bomb moral desaster killed people the film clearly stick argument without bomb japanese hadnt capitulated there minor dream scene oppenheimer stepping ash one single victim instead main concern story oppenheimer reputation wether close relationship communist party so another film mccarthy era best good night good luck told better story eraso navel show usa witch hunt communist world war but distraction real important question wether usgovernment became monster hunting nazi monster until word sorry dropping two atomic bomb obama trump biden visited hiroshima g junenolans movie stick strictly view oppenheimer u military never switching japanese view it could much a missed opportunity nolans second worst movie insomnia,"Counter({'NOUN': 48, 'PROPN': 28, 'ADJ': 27, 'VERB': 19, 'ADV': 12, 'DET': 6, 'AUX': 3, 'CCONJ': 2, 'PRON': 2, 'NUM': 2, 'SCONJ': 1, 'PART': 1, 'ADP': 1})","['first', 'half', 'heisenberg jean tatlock', 'half hour', 'second', 'japanese', 'one', 'nazi', 'two', 'japanese', 'second']","Counter({'ORDINAL': 3, 'CARDINAL': 3, 'NORP': 3, 'PERSON': 1, 'TIME': 1})"
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles.
